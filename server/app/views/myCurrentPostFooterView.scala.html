ubmicron device fabrication technologies based on opti-cal lithography are reaching fundamental, diffraction limitsas feature sizes approach 200 nm. The leading nanotechnolo-gies for suboptical~viz., 10–200 nm!fabrication areelectron-beam lithography~EBL!1–4and x-ray lithography~XRL!.4,5Although EBL has outstanding resolution yieldingfeatures of 1–2 nm in the most favorable cases, its serialprocessing format is a limitation to achieving commerciallyacceptable throughputs of 1 cm22s21. XRL resolution is lim-ited by photoelectron range and diffraction effects to 20–50nm; however, its parallel processing capabilities that permitsimultaneous fabrication of large numbers of nanostructuresis an extremely advantageous feature.Consequently there is substantial interest in developingnanofabrication techniques that combine the resolution ofEBL with the throughput of XRL. Nanolithography based onthe scanning tunneling microscope~STM!has received con-siderable attention6since it can image and manipulate matteron the atomic scale.7,8The application of STM lithography,like EBL, may be limited by serial processing speeds. Con-sequently novel approaches to parallel nanolithography arebeing explored including~1!diffusion-controlled aggrega-tion at surfaces;9~2!laser-focused atom deposition;10–12and~3!nanometer-scale  template  formation  from  two-dimensional~2D!crystalline protein monolayers,13the poresof aluminum oxide thin films,14and self-assembled polymernanospheres forming a single monolayer~SL!, ordered mo-saic array mask for deposition or reactive-ion
